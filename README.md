# Web-Visualization-Challenge

For this project, the goal is to use js to read in a json format data and have it plot some graph that will be connected to a html file. There is multiple test subject within the data set so user can picked which subject's data they would like to view. The data displayed will change as user pick a different subject. The result page will also contain a bar graph and bubble graph that shows the subject's OTU values.
